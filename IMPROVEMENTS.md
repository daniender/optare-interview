##Several points to add:

#### 游릭 Swagger API for testing, use and documentation

#### 游릭 OpenApi contract

#### 游릭 Mapstruct to generate code from Openapi

#### 游릭 Checkstyle or similar to standarize code format and rules

#### 游릭 SonarLint or similar to check code coverture and code smells

#### 游릭 api gateway

#### 游릭 off course some logging fwk to connect to an elastic related app

#### 游릭 technical, use and functional metrics to send them to some queue system to be presented in Grafana or similar and some tracing system to be followed in Zipkin or similar tool


###Talking about deployment I will go for container architecture and use Eureka, Docker, etc.


##Missing:

#### 游댮 Mapper for transformation from JSON returned by external API to POJO
